# This Nth Swift Project

I will be learning Swift, one project at a time.

This project was inspired by [30DaysOfSwift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift) and serves as my latest motivation to learning swift and getting really awesome at native mobile programming.

Don't know how often I'll update this. My goal is a weekly project due Fridays or Sundays.
